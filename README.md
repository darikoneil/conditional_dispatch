# conditional_dispatch
Decorator for dispatching a function's implementation according to registered conditional statements. While using a similar syntax to python's standard library's [singledispatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch), it supports arbitrary conditional statements on single or multiple input arguments.
